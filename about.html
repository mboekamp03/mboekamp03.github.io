            <p id="about-para"> On this page, you will be able to find out all about me as well as any relevant links. Now, a little bit about me. I was born in Providence, RI and have lived in Cranston, RI my whole life. I attened La Salle Academy prior to coming to URI. Now, at URI, I spent my freshman year exploring different fields by taking different classes such as biology and chemistry. The majority of my classes were enjoyable, but I couldn't see myself making a career out of any of them. Right now, at the beginning of my sophmore year, I can easiily see myself doing computer science as a major and a career. I look forward to seeing where this class and any that follow it will take me.</p>
